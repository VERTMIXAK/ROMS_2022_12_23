The first thing you need is a template grid file. The number of x/y points is always the same, so this only needs to be
done once.

The next thing you need is a template HIS file, which depends on the number of layers. Keep the basic file structure by
creating a BC_IC directory, which contains and ini directory with the python scripts that create the IC file. These scripts
refer to an entry in
	~/Python/gridid.txt
and can have any stretching and Nz you want.
