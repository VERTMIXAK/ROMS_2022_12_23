1) First of all, change the minimum depth in bathtub from 5 to 50.

/*

2) Use the modified topo source file which has
	a) the latitude field is shifted a smidgie
	b) each bathy point is replaced with a 3x3 nanmean


If you look in the modifiedTopo30 directory you see two copies of the topo30 source file, both of which differ from
the original in
	ROMS/BathyData
The latitude field is shifted a smidge (.01 deg) in both. One of the files

topo30.Gridpak_SEAK_shiftSmooth.nc

also has some smoothing - a nanmean of the 3x3 box of points surrounding each bathymetry point not under the land mask.

If you do an ncdiff of these two files you see the (subtle) difference.



3) get rid of potholes with a simple 3x3 nanmean

2) run Harper's hls_butterworth script on minimum -    1/3

3) run bathsuds with 3 iterations

4) run bathsoap with 1 iteration
