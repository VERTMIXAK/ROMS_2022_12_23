! Input parameters can be entered in ANY order, provided that the parameter   !
! KEYWORD (usually, upper case) is typed correctly followed by "="  or "=="   !
! symbols. Any comment lines are allowed and must begin with an exclamation   !
! mark (!) in column one.  Comments may  appear to the right of a parameter   !
! specification to improve documentation.  Comments will be ignored  during   !
! reading.  Blank lines are also allowed and ignored. Continuation lines in   !
! a parameter specification are allowed and must be preceded by a backslash   !
! (\).  In some instances, more than one value is required for a parameter.   !
! If fewer values are provided, the  last value  is assigned for the entire   !
! parameter array.  The multiplication symbol (*),  without blank spaces in   !
! between, is allowed for a parameter specification.  For example, in a two   !
! grids nested application:                                                   !

! indicates that the first two entries of array AKT_BAK,  in fortran column-  !
! major order, will have the same value of "1.0d-6" for grid 1,  whereas the  !
! next two entries will have the same value of "5.0d-6" for grid 2.           !
!                                                                             !
! In multiple levels of nesting and/or multiple connected domains  step-ups,  !
! "Ngrids" entries are expected for some of these parameters.  In such case,  !
! the order of the entries for a parameter is extremely important.  It  must  !
! follow the same order (1:Ngrids) as in the state variable declaration. The  !
! USER may follow the above guidelines for specifying his/her values.  These  !
! parameters are marked by "==" plural symbol after the KEYWORD.              !

     Lfloats == T

! Flag indicating re-start from previous solution. If FRREC = 0, a new
! NetCDF output file is created.

       FRREC == 0

! Number of floats to release in each nested grid.  These values are
! essential because the FLOATS structure in "mod_floats" is dynamically
! allocated using these values, [1:Ngrids].

! This is the number of locations times the number of days in the experiment
     NFLOATS == 42000

! Initial floats locations for all grids:
!
!   G      Nested grid number
!   C      Initial horizontal coordinate type (0: grid units, 1: spherical)
!   T      Float trajectory type (1: Lagrangian, 2: isobaric, 3: Geopotential)
!   N      Number floats to be released at (Fx0,Fy0,Fz0)
!   Ft0    Float release time (days) after model initialization
!   Fx0    Initial float X-location (grid units or longitude)
!   Fy0    Initial float Y-location (grid units or latitude)
!   Fz0    Initial float Z-location (grid units or depth)
!   Fdt    Float cluster release time interval (days)
!   Fdx    Float cluster X-distribution parameter
!   Fdy    Float cluster Y-distribution parameter
!   Fdz    Float cluster Z-distribution parameter
